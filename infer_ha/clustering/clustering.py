"""
This wrapper module enables the selection of different approaches to the clustering algorithm.
Using this wrapper module, one can implement and test different approaches to the clustering algorithm.
Below we have three approaches:
1) 'piecelinear': the original approach in the paper by Jin et al.
2) 'dbscan': The standard DBSCAN clustering
3) 'dtw': The approach using the DTW algorithm.

The learning algorithm is currently designed by focusing on the DTW algorithm.

    """
    A wrapper module that enables the selection of different approaches to the clustering algorithm.

    :param segmented_traj: is a list of a custom data structure consisting of segmented trajectories (positions). Each item
        of the list contains a tuple of the form ([start_ode, end_ode], [start_exact, end_exact], [p_1, ... , p_n]).
        The Tuple has 3 items:
            (1) first a list of two values for recording start and end points for learning ODE
            (2) second a list of two values for recording start and end points for learning guard and assignment using the
            exact point of jump
            (3) third the list of values represent the positions of points of the trajectories.
    :param A: For every point of a trajectory the coefficients of the monomial terms obtained using the \Phi
         function (or the mapping function) as mention in Jin et al. paper.
    :param b1: the derivatives of each point computed using the backward version of BDF.
    :param clfs: is a list. Each item of the list clfs is a list that holds the coefficients (obtained using linear
        regression) of the ODE of each segment of the segmented trajectories.
    :param Y: contains the y_list values for all the points except the first and last M points (M is the order in BDF).
    :param t_list: a single-item list whose item is a numpy.ndarray containing time-values as a concatenated list.
    :param L_y: is the dimension (input + output variables) of the system whose trajectory is being parsed.
    :param learning_parameters: is a dictionary data structure having the list of commandline arguments passed by the
        user for the learning algorithm.
    :return: The computed cluster and the coefficients of the polynomial ODE.
        P_modes: holds a list of modes. Each mode is a list of structures; we call it a segment.
        Thus, P = [mode-1, mode-2, ... , mode-n] where mode-1 = [ segment-1, ... , segment-n] and segments are
        of type ([start_ode, end_ode], [start_exact, end_exact], [p1, ..., p_n]).
        G: is a list containing the list of the coefficients of the polynomial ODE.
