    """
    Determine connecting points from the segmented trajectories concerning clusters. Our idea is to establish
    connections by determining segments' start and end positions/points on either mode (src and dest modes). We plan to
    use these points to determine assignments and guards between the modes. 'datapoints' is a list of points that
    connect a source and destination location. We consider the 'datapoints' as a triplet of type
    [pre_end_posi, end_posi, start_posi], where pre_end_posi and end_posi positions are on the source location, and
    start_posi is the position of the starting point of a segment in the destination location.

    :param P_modes: holds a list of modes. Each mode is a list of structures; we call it a segment.
          Thus, P = [mode-1, mode-2, ... , mode-n] where mode-1 = [ segment-1, ... , segment-n] and segments are
          of type ([start_ode, end_ode], [start_exact, end_exact], [p1, ..., p_n]).
    :param position: is a list of position data structure. Each position is a pair (start, end) position of a trajectory.
        For instance, the first item of the list [0, 100] means that the trajectory has 101 points.
        The second item as [101, 300], meaning the second trajectory has 200 points.
        Note that all the trajectories are concatenated.
    :param segmentedTrajectories: is a data structure containing the positions of the segmented trajectories that keeps
        track of the connections between them.
    :return: 'datapoints' is a list of data points that holds a connection between a source and destination location.
        The 'datapoints' is a triplet of type [pre_end_posi, end_posi, start_posi], where pre_end_posi and end_posi
        positions are on the source location, and start_posi is the position of the starting point of a segment in the
        destination location.
