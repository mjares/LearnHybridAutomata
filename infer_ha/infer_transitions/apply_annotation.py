    """
    Type Annotation function. Type annotation is performed on the assignments based on the variable's type.

    :param Y: contains the y_list values for all the points except the first and last M points (M is the order in BDF).
    :param variableType_datastruct: specific data structure holding user's information about type annotation values.
    :param list_connection_pt: is the connection triplet having (pre-end, end, start) point/position for a connection.
    :param assignment_coeff: contains the values of the coefficients for the assignment equation.
    :param assignment_intercept: contains the values of the intercepts for the assignment equation.
    :return: the coefficients and intercept values of the assignment equations.

    Examples:
    For variable having index i, do the following for the variable of
    type 't1' (continuous)
        1) set coefficient with index i, to 1 and 0 to the rest
        2) set the intercept value to 0 for index i
    type 't2' (from pool values, majority polling: when equal takes the 1st value)
        from the destination connection_pt[1] get the concrete value of variable index i and do the frequency count of each pool-values
        which is supplied by the user and select the highest frequency count pool-value (say pv)
        Now,
        1) set all coefficient with index i, to 0
        2) set the intercept value to pv for index i

    type 't3' (constant assignment or the jump reset assignment)
        1) set all coefficient with index i, to 0
        2) set the intercept value to the constant value for index i
