    This function decides to compute or ignore mode-invariant computation based on the user's choice.


    :param P_modes: holds a list of modes. Each mode is a list of structures; we call it a segment.
        Thus, P = [mode-1, mode-2, ... , mode-n] where mode-1 = [ segment-1, ... , segment-n] and segments are
        of type ([start_ode, end_ode], [start_exact, end_exact], [p1, ..., p_n]).
    :param position: is a list of position data structure. Each position is a pair (start, end) position of a trajectory.
        For instance, the first item of the list is [0, 100] means that the trajectory has 101 points. The second item
        as [101, 300], meaning the second trajectory has 200 points. Note that all the trajectories are concatenated.
    :param segmentedTrajectories: is a data structure containing the positions of the segmented trajectories that keeps
        track of the connections between them.
    :param L_y: is the dimension (input + output variables) of the system whose trajectory is being parsed.
    :param boundary_order: degree of the polynomial concerning the guard's equation.
    :param Y: contains the y_list values for all the points except the first and last M points (M is the order in BDF).
    :param variableType_datastruct: specific data structure holding user's information about type annotation values.
    :param number_of_segments_before_cluster: total number of segments obtained using the segmentation process and
        before applying the clustering algorithm.
    :param number_of_segments_after_cluster: total number of segments obtained after applying the clustering algorithm.
    :return: A list of transitions of type [src_mode, dest_mode, guard_coeff, assignment_coeff, assignment_intercept].
        Where src_mode, and dest_mode store the source and destination location ID. The guard_coeff structure holds the
        coefficients of the guard polynomial. Whereas assignment_coeff and assignment_intercept contain the
        coefficients and intercepts value for the assignment equations.
