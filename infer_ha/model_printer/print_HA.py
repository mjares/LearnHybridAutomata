def print_HA(P_modes, G, mode_inv, transitions, position, learning_parameters, outputfilename):
    """

    :param P_modes: holds a list of modes. Each mode is a list of structures; we call it a segment.
           Thus, P = [mode-1, mode-2, ... , mode-n] where mode-1 = [ segment-1, ... , segment-n] and segments are
           of type ([start_ode, end_ode], [start_exact, end_exact], [p1, ..., p_n]).
           The size of the list P_modes is equal to the number of clusters or modes of the learned hybrid automaton (HA).
    :param G: is a list. Each item of the list G is a list that holds the coefficients (obtained using linear regression)
           of the ODE of a mode of the learned HA.
    :param mode_inv: is a list with items of type [mode-id, invariant-constraints]. Where mode-id is the location number
                  and invariant-constraints holds the bounds (min, max) of each variable in the corresponding mode-id.
    :param transitions: is a list with structure [src_mode, dest_mode, guard_coeff, assignment_coeff, assignment_intercept]
                     where
            src_mode: is the source location number
            dest_mode: is the destination location number
            guard_coeff: is a list containing the coefficient of the guard equation (polynomial)
            assignment_coeff: is a list containing the coefficient of the assignment equations (from linear regression)
            assignment_intercept: is a list containing the intercepts of the assignment equations (linear regression)
    :param position: is a list containing positions of the input list_of_trajectories. This structure is required for printing
            the HA model. Particularly, to get the starting positions of input trajectories for identifying initial mode(s).
    :param learning_parameters: is a dictionary data structure containing all the parameters required for our learning
            algorithm. The arguments of the learning_parameters can also be passed as a command-line arguments. The
            command-line usages can be obtained using the --help command. To find the details of the arguments see the
            file/module "utils/commandline_parser.py"
    :param outputfilename: name of the file where the HA model is printed as an output.
