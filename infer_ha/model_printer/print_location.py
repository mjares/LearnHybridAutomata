    :param G: is a list. Each item of the list G is a list that holds the coefficients (obtained using linear regression)
           of the ODE of a mode of the learned HA.
    :param mode_inv: is a list with items of type [mode-id, invariant-constraints]. Where mode-id is the location number
                  and invariant-constraints holds the bounds (min, max) of each variable in the corresponding mode-id.
    :param Exp: is the polynomial expression obtained from the mapping \Phi function.
    :param position: is a list containing positions of the input list_of_trajectories. This structure is required for printing
            the HA model. Particularly, to get the starting positions of input trajectories for identifying initial mode(s).

    At the moment we are printing only the mode-ID where the first/starting trajectory is contained in.
    Finding other initial modes, require searching segmented trajectories and identifying the probable initial positions
    of the trajectories. Probable because we still drop points during segmentation (the start-point of a segmented trajectory).
    This dropping of points (in addition to the first M points, where M is the step in LMM) makes it hard to track the
    position of the initial trajectories using the data-structure position.
