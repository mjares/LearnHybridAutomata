# LearnHybridAutomata
Simplified version of the tools presented in https://github.com/rajgurung777/learnHA.git.

Script_Repo_Tests.py runs the tests available in the original repository.

Script_LearnNew_HAModel.py can be used to produce new hybrid automata models from new traces.

Traces must be provided as .txt files (examples can be found in the 'data' folder).

Python modules required: 
- fastdtw
- scipy 1.7.2
